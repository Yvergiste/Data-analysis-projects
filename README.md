# Cohort Analysis for Assessing Customer Retention
## Cohort Analysis for assessing customer retention in E-commerce industry
In this project, I delved into Cohort Analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior. This analytical approach enabled me to segment customers into cohorts based on their purchase behavior over time, which was instrumental in identifying key retention opportunities and optimizing marketing efforts. By analyzing these cohorts, I developed strategies that helped businesses improve customer engagement and increase the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.
## Business Overview/Problem
## Business Problem
E-Shop Pro is facing a significant challenge in retaining its customers. While the company has been successful in acquiring new customers through marketing efforts and promotions, it has noticed a concerning trend of declining customer retention rates. This is a critical issue in the highly competitive e-commerce industry, where customer loyalty and repeat business are paramount.
While E-Shop Pro collects vast amounts of customer data, it has not effectively leveraged this data to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. This underutilization of data is a missed opportunity for improving customer retention.

## Rationale for the Project
Cohort analysis is a powerful technique used in business analytics to gain insights into the behavior and characteristics of specific groups of customers, users, or any defined segments over time. These groups, or cohorts, share a common characteristic or experience, such as the date of their first purchase, sign-up, or acquisition.
The primary purpose of cohort analysis is to track how different cohorts perform and behave over their entire lifecycle, allowing businesses to understand their customer retention, engagement, and revenue generation patterns. Here's a breakdown of key elements in cohort analysis:
Cohort analysis is a valuable tool in the realm of customer retention because it provides businesses with a deeper understanding of customer behavior over time. Here are reasons why carrying out cohort analysis is essential for assessing and improving customer retention:
A. Identifying Retention Trends: cohort analysis allows businesses to group customers based on specific criteria, such as their acquisition date or first purchase. By tracking these cohorts over time, it becomes easier to identify trends in customer behavior, including whether retention rates are increasing or decreasing.
B. Pinpointing Churn Patterns: Cohort analysis helps in identifying when and why customers tend to churn or stop making repeat purchases. This information is crucial for devising strategies to reduce churn and retain more customers.

## Aim of the Project
This project aims to gain comprehensive insights into user engagement patterns and content preferences on the Streamlix platform. 
By conducting a rigorous cohort analysis, Streamlix seeks to understand the evolving behavior of distinct user groups over specific timeframes. This endeavor is driven by the imperative to refine content curation, optimize user experience, and ultimately, maximize user satisfaction.

## Data Description
✓ InvoiceNo: A unique identifier for each invoice or transaction, often used for tracking and reference purposes.
✓ StockCode: A code or identifier associated with a specific product or item in the e-commerce store's inventory, used for cataloging and tracking purposes.
✓ Description: A categorical feature that provides a brief textual description of the product or item being sold, offering clarity to customers about what they are purchasing.
✓ Quantity: The quantity or number of units of a product that were included in the transaction, indicating the purchase volume for each item.
✓ InvoiceDate: The date and time when the transaction or invoice was generated, offering insights into when purchases were made and allowing for temporal analysis.
✓ UnitPrice: Indicating the total cost of the items purchased.
✓ CustomerID: A unique identifier associated with each customer or shopper, allowing for customer-specific analysis and tracking of individual purchasing behavior.
✓ Country: The name of the country where the customer is located or where the transaction occurred.

## Tech Stack
### Programming language – Python
### Libraries
A. Numpy: For performing mathematical operations over data
B. Pandas: For Data Analysis and Manipulation
C. Matplotlib.pyplot: For Data Visualization
D. Seaborn: For Data Visualization
E. Scikit-learn: For Machine Learning

## Project Scope
A. Exploratory Data Analysis
the data is thoroughly explored and analysed to gain insights and understand its characteristics. This involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and other exploratory techniques to identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and potential issues in the data.
B. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating or selecting relevant features (input variables) from the available data that will be used for modeling. It may involve feature extraction, transformation, scaling, or the creation of new features to improve the predictive power of the models.
C. Model Development
Various modeling techniques are applied to the prepared data in this stage to build predictive or descriptive models. This can include machine learning algorithms, statistical models, or other analytical approaches. The models are trained, validated, and fine-tuned to optimize their performance.
D. Model Evaluation and Selection
Once the models are developed, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This involves assessing their performance, generalizability, and robustness. The best-performing model(s) are selected for further deployment or refinement.

# Interpretation of Cohort Analysis
## Overview:
The cohort analysis table displays the percentage of customers who continue to engage with the business over time, relative to their initial number in the first month (cohort month). Each row represents a cohort based on the month of first interaction, and each column represents the percentage of those customers who returned in subsequent months.

## Key Insights:
- Initial Engagement Drop-Off: There is a noticeable drop in customer retention after the first month for all cohorts. For instance, from the December 2010 cohort, only 38.19% of customers returned in the second month.
- Mid-Term Retention Fluctuations: Some cohorts, such as those from December 2010 and March 2011, show fluctuations in retention rates, with some months showing an increase in customer retention. This could indicate promotional efforts or seasonal influences.
- Long-Term Retention Decline: As expected, there is a general decline in customer retention over time, with the most recent months showing lower percentages of returning customers.
## Business Implications:
- Customer Retention Challenges: The consistent decline in customer retention indicates challenges in maintaining long-term engagement with customers. This could impact customer lifetime value and overall revenue.
- Possible Seasonal Influences: The fluctuations in mid-term retention suggest that certain periods may see higher engagement, potentially due to seasonality, promotions, or other factors.
- Need for Engagement Strategies: The data highlights the importance of developing strategies to enhance customer retention, particularly after the initial purchase period.
## Probing Questions:
- What specific factors contribute to the initial drop-off in customer engagement?
- Are there particular months or seasonal trends that coincide with changes in retention rates?
- What customer feedback or data do we have that could explain fluctuations in mid-term retention?
# Recommendations:
1. Enhanced Onboarding and Follow-Up: Implement strategies to improve the onboarding process and maintain engagement immediately after the first purchase, such as personalized follow-ups or incentives.
2. Seasonal Promotions and Retargeting: Analyze and leverage seasonal trends by implementing targeted marketing campaigns and promotions during periods with historically higher retention rates.
3. Customer Experience Improvement: Gather and analyze customer feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement in the customer journey. Address these to enhance overall satisfaction and loyalty.
- By focusing on these areas, the business can aim to improve customer retention, ultimately increasing customer lifetime value and driving sustainable growth.
